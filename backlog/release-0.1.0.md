# Release 0.1.0

## Completed Features

[x] Scaffold a Python minimal package called `navam-invest` which will offer AI agents and tools for the retail investor. The package will be published on PyPi and has a public GitHub repo which is setup as remote. Do not create any modules just yet, instead setup the project and virtual environment for python package development.

## Implementation Details

### Project Structure
- Created modern Python package structure following 2025 best practices
- Used `pyproject.toml` as the single source of configuration
- Implemented `src/` layout for better package isolation
- Set up `tests/` directory for test suite

### Configuration Files
- **pyproject.toml**: Complete package metadata with:
  - Build system using Hatchling
  - Project metadata (name, version, description, dependencies)
  - Development dependencies (pytest, black, ruff, mypy)
  - Tool configurations (black, ruff, mypy, pytest)

- **.gitignore**: Comprehensive Python gitignore covering:
  - Python bytecode and cache files
  - Virtual environments
  - Distribution files
  - IDE and OS specific files
  - Test coverage reports

- **README.md**: Professional documentation with:
  - Project overview and features
  - Installation instructions
  - Development setup guide
  - Code quality tools documentation
  - Project structure visualization

### Virtual Environment
- Created `.venv/` using Python 3.13.0
- Ready for editable installation with `pip install -e ".[dev]"`

```

### Dependencies
- **Runtime**: anthropic>=0.40.0 (for AI agent functionality)
- **Development**: pytest, pytest-cov, black, ruff, mypy

### Next Steps
Package is now ready for:
1. Installation in development mode: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
2. Implementation of AI agents and investment tools
3. Publishing to PyPI when ready

## Version
0.1.0 (Alpha)

---

[x] Enhanced CLAUDE.md with comprehensive LangGraph and LangChain development essentials based on latest documentation in refer/langgraph/ folder.

## Implementation Details

### CLAUDE.md Enhancement

Added comprehensive "LangGraph & LangChain Development Essentials" section covering:

#### 1. Quick Start Foundation
- **Installation**: Essential package requirements
- **Essential Imports**: Most commonly used imports organized by category
- **5-Minute Quick Start**: Complete working example from state definition to execution

#### 2. Core Development Patterns
Five essential patterns every developer needs:
1. **State Schema Design**: Proper use of TypedDict and Annotated types
2. **Building Custom Graphs**: When and how to use StateGraph
3. **Persistence Pattern**: Critical checkpointer setup for production
4. **Tool Definition**: Creating effective agent capabilities
5. **Streaming Pattern**: Real-time updates for responsive UX

#### 3. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
Four critical mistakes with wrong/correct examples:
1. Message list annotation (add_messages vs plain list)
2. Checkpointer in production (stateless vs stateful)
3. Synchronous vs streaming invocation
4. Tool docstrings (unclear vs descriptive)

#### 4. Decision Tree
Clear guidance on when to use which approach:
- Simple tool-calling vs custom workflow
- Single vs multi-agent
- Memory requirements
- Production deployment considerations

#### 5. LangChain Core Components
Detailed coverage of 5 key components:
1. **Chat Models**: init_chat_model, direct instantiation, fallbacks
2. **Messages**: HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage, ToolMessage
3. **Tools**: @tool decorator, structured tools, validation
4. **Prompts**: ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder
5. **Output Parsers**: PydanticOutputParser for structured responses

#### 6. LangChain vs LangGraph
Comparison table showing when to use each framework:
- Simple chains vs stateful workflows
- One-shot vs multi-turn conversations
- Linear flow vs conditional branching

#### 7. Essential Patterns for navam-invest
Four critical patterns with code examples:
1. Tool-equipped LLM
2. Structured output
3. Retry with fallback
4. Batch processing

### Documentation References
All patterns include direct references to relevant documentation:
- `refer/langgraph/guides/streaming.md`
- `refer/langgraph/guides/persistence.md`
- `refer/langgraph/guides/tools.md`
- `refer/langgraph/guides/multi-agent.md`
- `refer/langgraph/cloud/python-sdk-reference.md`

### Benefits
This enhancement provides:
- ✅ Instant reference for common development tasks
- ✅ Clear examples preventing common mistakes
- ✅ Decision framework for architecture choices
- ✅ Direct links to comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Investment-specific implementation patterns
- ✅ Production-ready code examples

### File Statistics
- Original CLAUDE.md: ~288 lines
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md: 573 lines
- Added: ~285 lines of crisp, actionable development guidance
