# Release 0.1.38

## Status
RELEASED - 2025-10-14

## Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features

**ESC Key Cancellation for Agent Execution** - Non-blocking TUI improvements

Resolved critical UX issue where the TUI became completely unresponsive during agent execution. Users can now:
- Press ESC to cancel long-running agent operations
- Scroll the chat log while agent is processing
- Maintain full UI responsiveness during execution

**Technical Implementation:**
- Refactored agent execution to use Textual's worker pattern
- Worker runs in background without blocking event loop
- `on_worker_state_changed()` handles completion asynchronously
- Proper cleanup of async streams on cancellation
- Graceful cancellation without UI freeze

**Key Changes:**
- `src/navam_invest/tui/app.py` - Worker-based execution (~+536 lines)
- Added `ESC_CANCEL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical documentation
- Added test examples: `test_esc_worker.py`, `test_esc_cancel.py`

**User Experience Improvements:**
- ESC key binding visible in footer: "ESC Cancel | Ctrl+C Clear | Ctrl+Q Quit"
- Cancellation feedback: "‚ö†Ô∏è Cancellation requested - stopping agent..."
- Completion message: "üõë Agent execution cancelled by user"
- Placeholder shows: "‚è≥ Processing... (Press ESC to cancel)"

- Cache warming for common queries
- Configurable cache TTL per data source

**Workflow Progress Visualization** - Enhanced TUI:
- Enhanced TUI display for multi-agent workflows
- Visual progress indicators for each agent
- Better error recovery and partial completion handling
