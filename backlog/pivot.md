# Pivot

You are an expert agentic AI system developer using LangGraph, Langchain, and Python. Think harder to perform these steps:

1. Understand the current state of the project including source, docs, and releases
2. Research best practices of developing agentic systems using LangGraph online
3. Read LangGraph docs available at refer/langgraph/ folder
4. Understand the current approach using agents by switching to them using /command and prompting them explicitly
5. Pivot to prompt routing or orchestration capability which uses a routing agent to understand which agent to call
6. Ideal user experience is not having to explictly activate any agents, just prompt their intent, and Navam Invest calls the right agents, tools, to get the job done
7. Write the pivot plan in backlog/active.md updating the sequence of the current open items according the to plan
8. Move the exisiting completed items from backlog/active.md to respective release files.
