# Active Backlog

[ ] When running `navam invest` and user enters the `/porfolio` or `/research` commands. Provide few usable prompt examples which provide good coverage of all tools. Add `/examples` command to randomly rotate among a pre-hydrated set of prompts based on the agent active.

[ ] Provide a capability to read files within the folder where `navam invest` is running and bring files content into conversation context.

[ ] Make user prompt area multi-line capable.

[ ] Create next release of `navam_invest` package which adds more agents and tools based on refer/specs/api-tools.md prioritized list of APIs.
