# Active Backlog

[ ] Review refer/specs/api-tools.md and research online for open APIs and APIs with decent free-tier limits to replace FMP API as it is not offering many capabilities in free tier.

[ ] Add tools from following API sources https://finnhub.io/ https://www.marketaux.com and accordingly assign these tools to existing agents or create new agents which cooperate with existing ones to meet the Navam Invest product specifications.

[ ] Make chat response area selectable for copying text

[ ] Create next release of `navam_invest` package which adds more agents and tools based on refer/specs/api-tools.md prioritized list of APIs.
