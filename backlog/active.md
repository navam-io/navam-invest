# Active Backlog

[ ] When running `navam invest` provide `/quit` command to quit instead of control+q as the latter interferes with VS Code terminal. Update the chat footer accordingly.

[ ] Provide a capability to read files within the folder where `navam invest` is running and bring files content into conversation context.

[ ] Make user prompt area multi-line capable.

[ ] Create next release of `navam_invest` package which adds more agents and tools based on refer/specs/api-tools.md prioritized list of APIs.
