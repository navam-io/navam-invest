# Active Backlog

[ ] Instead of `navam tui` command change to `navam invest` command to start the chat interface

[ ] Read refer/specs/about.md to understand the Navam Invest product vision and stack. Refer refer/specs/tui-spec-by-chatgpt.md for TUI specifications. Update CLAUDE.md files within the project with crisp reference to these docs to memorize these concepts.

[ ] Create next release of `navam_invest` package which adds more agents and tools based on refer/specs/api-tools.md prioritized list of APIs.
