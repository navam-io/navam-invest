Think harder to complete these tasks:
1. Verify pyproject.toml version matches current release-{version}.md file (do NOT increment)
2. Build the package for PyPi distribution
3. Test the PyPi distribution
4. Publish to PyPi
5. Update current release-{version}.md: change "IN DEVELOPMENT" to published date and PyPI URL
6. Create release-{next-version}.md for next development cycle
7. Increment pyproject.toml version to next patch version
8. Commit and push all changes with message: "chore: Release v{version} to PyPI"
