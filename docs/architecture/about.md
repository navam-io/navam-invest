Navam Invest is an AI-powered investment-advisory platform that brings institutional-grade portfolio intelligence to individual retail investors. Built with LangGraph and packaged as a local-first Python application, it replaces the traditional wealth-management middle layer with a team of specialized AI agents that research markets, analyze macro trends, screen securities, optimize portfolios, and explain recommendations in clear, educational language. For investors managing their own $50 K – $1 M portfolios, Navam Invest acts like a digital investment committee—continuously monitoring holdings, risk, and tax efficiency using free, high-quality public data sources such as FRED, SEC EDGAR, and Alpha Vantage. It is needed because most retail investors either rely on costly advisory firms charging 1 % AUM fees or on fragmented DIY tools that offer little personalization or transparency. Navam Invest bridges this gap by providing autonomous, explainable, and audit-ready investment guidance that empowers users to make informed decisions with the same analytical depth and discipline once reserved for institutional portfolios.

Navam Invest is built on a modular, extensible tech stack designed for transparency, performance, and adaptability. At its core is LangGraph, which orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents—each responsible for tasks like portfolio analysis, macroeconomic insight, or tax optimization—while maintaining full audit trails and memory across sessions. The entire system is packaged as a Python library (navam_invest), making it easy to extend, test, and integrate with other workflows. A modern Textual-based Text UI (TUI) and Typer CLI provide an interactive chat-style experience that streams real-time agent reasoning, research summaries, and portfolio recommendations directly in the terminal. By default, Navam Invest uses Anthropic’s Claude models for reasoning, compliance, and education tasks, but it is model-agnostic—supporting seamless integration with other frontier LLMs such as OpenAI, Gemini, and DeepSeek, as well as local small models through Ollama for private, offline analysis. This architecture allows Navam Invest to combine cloud-scale intelligence with local autonomy, offering both security and flexibility for sophisticated retail investors.
