# Documentation Reorganization - Completion Summary

**Date**: January 10, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Reorganized project documentation into a structured `docs/` folder with consistent naming conventions and comprehensive coverage of all features through v0.1.32.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created docs/ Folder Structure

```
docs/
├── README.md                           # Documentation index
├── faq.md                              # Comprehensive FAQ
├── user-guide/
│   ├── getting-started.md             # Quick start guide
│   ├── agents.md                      # Agent reference (from refer/specs/)
│   ├── multi-agent-workflows.md       # Workflow patterns (from refer/specs/)
│   └── api-tools.md                   # API tools reference (from refer/specs/)
├── architecture/
│   ├── about.md                       # System architecture (from refer/specs/)
│   └── agents-tools-mapping.md        # Tool assignments (from refer/specs/)
└── development/
    ├── api-command-implementation.md  # (from root ALL_CAPS)
    ├── api-status-report.md           # (from root ALL_CAPS)
    ├── newsapi-updates.md             # (from root ALL_CAPS)
    └── release-v0.1.28.md             # (from root ALL_CAPS)
```

### 2. Moved Files from Root

- `LICENSE` - MIT license
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines

### 3. Copied Files from refer/specs/

**Updated**: 1 file (README.md links)

**Total Documentation Files**: 12 files in docs/ folder

## Naming Convention

**Adopted kebab-case** (lowercase with hyphens) for consistency:
- `api-command-implementation.md` (not `API_COMMAND_IMPLEMENTATION.md`)
- `multi-agent-workflows.md` (not `multi-agents.md`)
- `getting-started.md` (descriptive, clear)

## Benefits

## Documentation Coverage

**All Features Through v0.1.32 Documented**:

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add video tutorials/GIFs to Getting Started
- [ ] Create agent-specific deep-dive guides
- [ ] Add API integration tutorials
- [ ] Create troubleshooting flowcharts
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Create contribution guide for documentation

## Backward Compatibility

**Maintained** (no broken links):
- `README.md` updated with new structure
- Old `refer/specs/` files still exist (copies made, not moved)
- Release notes in `backlog/` untouched
- `CLAUDE.md` remains in root (as required by Claude Code)

## Verification

```bash
# Verify structure
tree docs/

# Check moved files
ls docs/development/

# Check copied files  
ls docs/user-guide/ docs/architecture/

# Verify root is clean
ls -la *.md

# Test links in README
# (manually verify all links point to correct locations)
```
