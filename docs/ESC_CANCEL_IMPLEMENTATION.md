# ESC Cancellation Implementation

## Overview

Implemented ESC key cancellation functionality for `navam invest` command using Textual's worker pattern to prevent event loop blocking.

## Problem Statement

**Root Cause**: The `async for event in agent.astream()` loops in `on_input_submitted` completely block Textual's event loop, preventing:
- ESC key event processing
- UI scrolling
- Any other UI interactions

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Worker-Based Execution

Moved agent streaming from synchronous event handler to background worker:

```python
# Before (blocking):
async for event in agent.astream(...):
    # Process events - BLOCKS EVENT LOOP

# After (non-blocking):
worker = self.run_worker(self._run_agent_stream(...))
result = await worker.wait()  # Yields control to event loop
```

### 2. Key Changes

**File**: `src/navam_invest/tui/app.py`

#### Added Imports
```python
from textual.worker import Worker, WorkerState
```

#### Added Bindings
```python
BINDINGS = [
    ("ctrl+q", "quit", "Quit"),
    ("ctrl+c", "clear", "Clear"),
    ("escape", "cancel", "Cancel"),  # NEW
]
```

#### Added State Tracking
```python
self.agent_worker: Optional[Worker] = None
self.cancellation_requested: bool = False
```

#### New Method: `_run_agent_stream`
Worker-compatible method that:
- Runs agent.astream() in background
- Periodically yields control with `await asyncio.sleep(0)`
- Checks `self.cancellation_requested` flag in loop
- Returns `(response, was_cancelled)` tuple
- Handles `asyncio.CancelledError` gracefully

#### New Method: `action_cancel`
ESC key handler that:
- Sets `self.cancellation_requested = True`
- Displays cancellation message
- Calls `self.agent_worker.cancel()`

#### Refactored: `on_input_submitted`
- Resets `self.cancellation_requested = False`
- Creates worker with `self.run_worker()`
- Awaits worker completion with `await worker.wait()`
- Checks cancellation status
- Skips report saving if cancelled

### 3. User Experience

**Before**:
- ESC key completely ignored during agent execution
- UI frozen, no scrolling possible
- No way to cancel long-running operations

**After**:
- ESC key immediately requests cancellation
- UI displays: `‚ö†Ô∏è  Cancellation requested - stopping agent...`
- Worker terminates gracefully
- UI displays: `üõë Agent execution cancelled by user`
- Placeholder shows: `‚è≥ Processing... (Press ESC to cancel)`
- Welcome message updated: `ESC Cancel | Ctrl+C Clear | Ctrl+Q Quit`

## Testing Approach

### Manual Testing Required

The implementation requires manual testing since automated tests cannot simulate:
1. User pressing ESC key during execution
2. UI responsiveness during worker execution
3. Graceful worker cancellation

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Basic Agent Query
```
1. Run: navam invest
2. Type: "What's the price of AAPL?"
3. Press: Enter
4. Immediately press: ESC
5. Expected: Agent stops, shows cancellation message
```

#### Scenario 2: UI Responsiveness
```
1. Run: navam invest
2. Type: "Analyze TSLA fundamentals"
3. Press: Enter
4. While agent is running:
   - Try scrolling the chat log (should work)
   - Try clicking different areas (should work)
   - UI should remain responsive
5. Press: ESC
6. Expected: Agent stops gracefully
```

#### Scenario 3: Router Mode
```
1. Run: navam invest (router mode is default)
2. Type: "Should I invest in NVDA?"
3. Press: Enter
4. Wait for router to select agent
5. Press: ESC during sub-agent execution
6. Expected: Router tool stops gracefully
```

#### Scenario 4: Multi-Agent Workflow
```
1. Run: navam invest
2. Type: "/analyze AAPL"
3. Press: Enter
4. Wait for Quill to start analysis
5. Press: ESC
6. Expected: Workflow stops, no report saved
```

#### Scenario 5: Let Agent Complete
```
1. Run: navam invest
2. Type: "What's the current GDP?"
3. Press: Enter
4. DO NOT press ESC
5. Let agent complete naturally
6. Expected: Normal completion, report saved
```

### Automated Test (Simplified)

A simplified worker pattern test is available:
```bash
python3 test_esc_worker.py
# Type 'test', press Enter, then press ESC
```

## Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Completed**:
- ESC key binding added
- Cancellation state tracking implemented
- Worker-based agent execution refactored
- Cancellation handler (`action_cancel`) implemented
- Background worker pattern applied to main agent stream
- User feedback messages added
- Placeholder and welcome message updated

‚è≥ **Pending** (requires manual testing):
- Verify UI remains responsive during execution
- Verify ESC cancellation works end-to-end
- Test with router mode
- Test with `/analyze` workflow
- Test with `/discover` workflow

‚ùå **Not Implemented** (out of scope):
- Workflow cancellation (`/analyze`, `/discover`) - still uses blocking pattern
- Background streaming task cancellation coordination

## Known Limitations

### 1. Workflows Not Updated
The `/analyze` and `/discover` commands still use blocking `async for` loops:
- Lines 639-689 (`/analyze` workflow)
- Lines 725-780 (`/discover` workflow)

These would need similar worker-based refactoring to support ESC cancellation.

### 2. Sub-Agent Streaming
The background streaming consumer (`_consume_streaming_events`) for progressive disclosure of sub-agent tool calls runs independently. Cancellation coordination between main worker and streaming task may need refinement.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Workflow Cancellation**: Apply worker pattern to `/analyze` and `/discover` commands
2. **Cancellation Feedback**: Show which sub-agent was interrupted when using router
3. **Partial Results**: Save partial analysis if user cancels after significant progress
4. **Confirmation Dialog**: Optional "Are you sure?" prompt before cancelling long operations
5. **Resume Capability**: Save state to allow resuming cancelled operations

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
None - the implementation is backward compatible.

### Configuration Changes
None required.

### Deployment
No special deployment steps needed. The changes are localized to `src/navam_invest/tui/app.py`.

## Author Notes

This implementation resolves the core issue: **UI event loop blocking during agent execution**.

The worker pattern allows the Textual event loop to process UI events (like ESC key presses) while the agent streaming happens in the background. The key insight is:

```python
# Yields control to event loop
await asyncio.sleep(0)

# Checks for cancellation
if self.cancellation_requested:
    break
```

Without this pattern, the event loop is completely blocked by the `async for` loop, making the entire UI unresponsive.

**Testing Required**: Manual testing is essential to verify:
1. ESC key works during execution
2. UI remains scrollable during execution
3. Cancellation is graceful and doesn't corrupt state
