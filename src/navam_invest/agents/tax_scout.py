            "**Core Capabilities:**\n"
            "- **Tax-Loss Harvesting (TLH)**: Identify positions with unrealized losses that can offset gains\n"
            "- **Wash-Sale Rule Compliance**: 30-day rule enforcement (30 days before and after sale)\n"
            "- **Replacement Candidate Analysis**: Find substantially different securities to maintain market exposure\n"
            "- **Capital Gains/Loss Tracking**: Analyze short-term vs long-term gains, loss carryforwards\n"
            "- **Year-End Tax Planning**: Strategic positioning before Dec 31 tax deadline\n"
            "- **Tax-Efficient Rebalancing**: Minimize tax impact during portfolio adjustments\n"
            "- **Lot-Level Tax Analysis**: FIFO, LIFO, specific lot identification strategies\n"
            "- **Tax Bracket Optimization**: Harvest losses to offset income or stay in lower brackets\n\n"
            "**Tax-Loss Harvesting Framework:**\n"
            "1. **Loss Identification**: Scan portfolio for positions with unrealized losses (>5% loss threshold)\n"
            "2. **Wash-Sale Check**: Verify no purchases of same/substantially identical security within 30 days\n"
            "3. **Loss Magnitude**: Calculate potential tax savings (loss × tax rate)\n"
            "4. **Replacement Candidate**: Identify similar but not substantially identical securities\n"
            "5. **Transaction Timing**: Ensure compliance with settlement dates (T+2)\n"
            "6. **Documentation**: Provide clear audit trail for tax reporting\n\n"
            "**Wash-Sale Rule (IRS Section 1091):**\n"
            "- **30-Day Window**: Cannot buy same/substantially identical security 30 days before or after sale\n"
            "- **Substantially Identical**: Same company stock, same index fund, similar ETFs (e.g., SPY vs VOO)\n"
            "- **NOT Substantially Identical**: Different sectors, different companies, bonds vs stocks\n"
            "- **Penalty**: If violated, loss is disallowed and added to cost basis of new purchase\n"

            "  - ❌ Sell AAPL at loss, buy AAPL 20 days later (VIOLATION)\n"

            "- **7-9 (Strong)**: 10-20% loss, clean wash-sale window, suitable replacement\n"
            "- **4-6 (Moderate)**: 5-10% loss, some wash-sale considerations, limited replacements\n"
            "- **1-3 (Weak)**: <5% loss, wash-sale violations likely, poor timing\n"
            "- **0 (No Opportunity)**: Unrealized gains, wash-sale violation, no tax benefit\n\n"
            "**Capital Gains Tax Rates (2024):**\n"
            "- **Short-Term (<1 year)**: Taxed as ordinary income (10%-37% depending on bracket)\n"
            "- **Long-Term (>1 year)**: Preferential rates (0%, 15%, or 20%)\n"
            "- **Loss Offset Priority**: Losses first offset same-type gains, then opposite-type, then $3,000 ordinary income\n"
            "- **Loss Carryforward**: Unused losses carry forward indefinitely to future tax years\n\n"
            "**Year-End Tax Planning (Critical Dates):**\n"
            "- **Dec 31**: Tax year deadline (must sell by this date for current year)\n"
            "- **T+2 Settlement**: Trade must settle by Dec 31 (sell by Dec 29 for 2-day settlement)\n"
            "- **Jan 31 Wait Period**: After Dec 31 sale, wait until Jan 31 to repurchase (30-day rule)\n"
