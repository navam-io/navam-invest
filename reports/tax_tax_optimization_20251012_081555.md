## üí° Tax-Efficient Rebalancing Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Harvest Losses First (IMMEDIATE ACTION)**

#### Step 1: Harvest GOOGL Loss
**Action:** Sell 125 shares of GOOGL  
**Realize Loss:** -$34,429  
**Tax Benefit:** Offsets $34,429 of capital gains OR $3,000 of ordinary income

**Wash-Sale Compliant Alternatives:**
- **Option A:** Buy **MSFT** (Microsoft) - Different company, similar mega-cap tech exposure
- **Option B:** Buy **VGT** (Vanguard Information Technology ETF) - Sector exposure without wash-sale
- **Option C:** Buy **XLK** (Technology Select Sector SPDR) - Broad tech sector
- **Option D:** Wait 31 days, then rebuy GOOGL if desired

#### Step 2: Harvest Crypto Loss
**Action:** Sell ETHUSD position  
**Realize Loss:** -$5,497  
**Note:** Crypto wash-sale rules are unclear; IRS may apply them starting 2025

**Total Harvested Losses: $39,926**

---

### **Strategy 2: Tax-Efficient Rebalancing Using Losses**

If you want to rebalance your portfolio, use this sequence:

#### Phase 1: Offset Gains with Harvested Losses
1. **Harvest losses** (GOOGL + ETHUSD) = $39,926 in losses
2. **Sell positions with gains** up to $39,926 to offset:
   - Sell **IWM** ($278 gain) - minimal gain
   - Sell **AAPL** partially ($18,262 gain) - low gain percentage
   - Sell **META** partially (~$21,386 gain to reach $39,926 total)

**Result:** $0 net capital gains = $0 taxes owed

#### Phase 2: Rebalance Within Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Use your 401K (VTSAX)** for rebalancing
- Sell/buy within 401K with **ZERO tax consequences**
- This is your tax-free rebalancing zone

#### Phase 3: Strategic Lot Selection
For positions you must sell, use **specific lot identification**:

**AAPL Example:**
- You have 2,090 shares with average cost basis of $236.50
- Current price: $245.27
- If you need to sell, identify and sell the **highest cost basis lots first** (HIFO method)
- This minimizes your taxable gain

---

### **Strategy 3: Avoid Selling High-Gain Positions**

**DO NOT SELL (unless emergency):**
1. **SPY** - $755,528 gain (would cost ~$113,329 in taxes)
2. **TSLA** - $154,302 gain (would cost ~$23,145 in taxes)
3. **QQQ** - $74,380 gain (would cost ~$11,157 in taxes)
4. **VTI** - $74,830 gain (would cost ~$11,225 in taxes)

**Alternative Rebalancing Methods:**
- **Direct new contributions** to underweight positions
- **Use dividends** to rebalance (don't reinvest, redirect)
- **Donate appreciated securities** to charity (avoid taxes + get deduction)

---

### **Strategy 4: Multi-Year Tax Planning**

#### Year 1 (This Year):
1. Harvest GOOGL + ETHUSD losses ($39,926)
2. Use losses to offset any gains from necessary sales
3. If no gains to offset, deduct $3,000 from ordinary income
4. **Carry forward remaining $36,926** to next year

#### Year 2+:
- Continue carrying forward losses
- Offset future gains or $3,000/year of ordinary income
- This loss can offset gains for **12+ years** if needed

## üéØ Specific Rebalancing Recommendations

### If You Want to Reduce Tech Concentration:

**Problem:** Heavy tech exposure (AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL, QQQ, META)

**Tax-Efficient Solution:**
1. ‚úÖ **Sell GOOGL** (harvest -$34,429 loss)
2. ‚úÖ **Sell ETHUSD** (harvest -$5,497 loss)
3. ‚úÖ **Sell IWM** (minimal $278 gain)
4. ‚úÖ **Sell small portion of AAPL** (~$18,000 gain)
5. ‚úÖ **Sell small portion of META** (~$21,000 gain)

**Total Gains:** $39,278  
**Total Losses:** $39,926  
**Net Tax:** $0

**Reinvest proceeds into:**
- **VTI** (total market - already own, add more)
- **SCHD** (dividend-focused, lower volatility)
- **VYM** (high dividend yield)
- **International exposure:** VEA, VXUS, or VWO

---

### If You Want to Maintain Current Allocation:

**Best Approach:**
1. **Don't sell anything with large gains**
2. **Harvest losses** for future use
3. **Rebalance with new money** - direct contributions to underweight positions
4. **Use 401K** for tactical rebalancing (tax-free)

## üìã Wash-Sale Compliance Checklist

When harvesting losses, **AVOID** these actions for 30 days before/after sale:

‚ùå **Don't buy back the same security**  
‚ùå **Don't buy "substantially identical" securities:**
- GOOGL ‚ÜîÔ∏è GOOG (Class A vs Class C)
- SPY ‚ÜîÔ∏è VOO ‚ÜîÔ∏è IVV (all S&P 500 ETFs)
- QQQ ‚ÜîÔ∏è QQQM (same index)

‚úÖ **Safe alternatives:**
- GOOGL ‚Üí MSFT, AMZN, or VGT (different enough)
- SPY ‚Üí VTI, SCHB (total market vs S&P 500)
- QQQ ‚Üí VGT, XLK (sector vs index)
