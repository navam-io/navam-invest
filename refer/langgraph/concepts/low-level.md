# LangGraph Low-Level Concepts: Graph API Architecture

## Core Workflow Principles

LangGraph models agent workflows as graphs with three fundamental components:

1. **State**: A shared data structure representing the current application snapshot
2. **Nodes**: Functions encoding agent logic that receive state, perform computations, and return updated state
3. **Edges**: Functions determining which node to execute next based on current state

## Graph Execution Model

LangGraph uses a "message passing" graph algorithm inspired by Google's Pregel system. The execution proceeds in "super-steps" where:

- Nodes begin in an `inactive` state
- A node becomes `active` when receiving a new message/state
- Nodes run functions and respond with updates
- Execution terminates when all nodes are `inactive`

## State Management

### State Definition

The graph state can be defined using:
- `TypedDict`
- `dataclass`
- Pydantic `BaseModel`

### Example State Definition

```python
from typing import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    input: str
    results: str
```

### State Update Mechanisms

- **Reducers**: Control how state updates are applied
- **Message Handling**: Built-in support for conversation message tracking
- Default behavior: Override previous values
- Custom reducers: Aggregate, append, or custom merge logic

## Nodes

Nodes are Python functions that:
- Accept current state
- Receive configuration details
- Access runtime context
- Return state updates

### Special Nodes

- `START`: Represents initial user input entry point
- `END`: Represents terminal graph nodes

### Example Node

```python
def process_node(state: State):
    return {"results": f"Processed: {state['input']}"}
```

## Edges

Edges define graph routing logic with three types:

### 1. Normal Edges
Direct node-to-node transitions

```python
builder.add_edge("node_a", "node_b")
```

### 2. Conditional Edges
Dynamic routing based on state

```python
def route_logic(state: State) -> str:
    if state['condition']:
        return "path_a"
    return "path_b"

builder.add_conditional_edge("decision_node", route_logic)
```

### 3. Entry Point Edges
Determine initial node execution

```python
builder.add_edge(START, "first_node")
```

## Basic Graph Structure Example

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    input: str
    results: str

builder = StateGraph(State)

def process_node(state: State):
    return {"results": f"Processed: {state['input']}"}

builder.add_node("process", process_node)
builder.add_edge(START, "process")
builder.add_edge("process", END)

graph = builder.compile()
```

## Advanced Features

### Runtime Context
Pass external configuration to nodes during execution

```python
def node_with_config(state: State, config: dict):
    user_pref = config.get("user_preference")
    return {"results": f"Using preference: {user_pref}"}
```

### Node Input Caching
Support for caching node inputs to optimize repeated computations

### Message Passing
Built-in utilities for managing conversational message flows

```python
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from typing import Annotated

class ChatState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
```

## Key Design Principles

1. **Explicit State Management**: All state changes are explicit and traceable
2. **Flexible Routing**: Conditional logic determines execution paths
3. **Composable Architecture**: Nodes and edges are modular building blocks
4. **Stateful Execution**: Maintain context across multiple steps
5. **Deterministic Replay**: Support for consistent execution replay

## Inspiration

LangGraph's architecture is inspired by:
- **Google Pregel**: Distributed graph processing
- **Apache Beam**: Unified batch and streaming data processing
